# Grid Dashboard

This one took me longer than I expected... in hours time probably about 10 hours or so.

Do I think it should have been quicker?  Not sure.  
The fun part for me here was using a Json to populate most of the areas.  Learning how to import and work with the elements through fetch -> then and wrapping my head around the process took some time.
